# Next.js App

This is the directory that houses the Next.js version of Simorgh.

The Next.js app shares components from the Express app (found in the root of the project). It is intended to be used for new page types, and in the future, will be used for the entire site.

For more information on Next.js and how to use the framework, see the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).

**Note:** We currently use the 'Pages Router' in Next.js, so be sure to select the "Using Pages Router" tab when viewing the Next.js documentation.
