# WS NextJS App

This is an early POC of a NextJS app to test rendering the new Live pages.

It utilises existing Simorgh components so as to practice 'evolutionary architecture', we gradually move towards to NextJS app without rebuilding all our React components from scratch. We will gradually migrate across our other page types to this app in the future.

## Setup

- Run `yarn install` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn dev` to start the development server on `http://localhost:7081`
- Navigate to `http://localhost:7081/kyrgyz/new_live/cz74kjpyk07t` to see the page
