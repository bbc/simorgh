# Cypress tests and our approach to E2E testing

[Introduction to Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress.html#Cypress-Is-Simple)

This folder contains all the Simorgh application end-to-end (E2E) tests and exclusively uses cypress as a testing framework. At present we run all E2E tests on all builds and deploys to all environments including live.

We aim to keep the code reusable but also to leverage the cypress framework as much as possible, here are some helpful hints. NB we're not perfect we're breaking our own guidelines and need help tidying up and making our tests more scalable.

## Directory Structure

## Running Tests

[Running Cypress locally](https://github.com/bbc/simorgh#end-to-end-tests)

Use the scripts from Simorgh's [package.json](https://github.com/bbc/simorgh/blob/latest/package.json#L39#L40) to run Cypress test locally on LIVE/TEST environment.

## Best Practises

[Cypress best practices](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html)

- Use the default cypress commands e.g. cy.get().[More defaults commands](https://docs.cypress.io/api/api/table-of-contents.html)
- Use the custom commands in `/support/command.js` directory.
- Code reusability is good but ease of understanding is better.
- If you're using a let, var or const in any test/helper/command in this repo, you're probably doing it unnecessarily, use cypress aliasing or chain requests.
- If trying to reuse tests always use cypress commands. i.e. don't export and import const's within cypress. Config is a sensible exception to this rule.
- Before writing a long/complex test, look to see if similar ones could be reused.
- Once you've written a test consider where else it might be helpful. For example testing a 200 response is useful on all requests and visits, so why not add it there in an additional PR (not in the same one to keep our PRs small and therefore fast to merge).
- Work together to consolidate the tests we have. Between the many tests in this folder are nearly all the tests we need, but are they as routinely used as they could be?
- Write as many tests as you please, but don't make them atomic. i.e. use .and() instead of a second test.
- The runtime of tests matters so make each as fast as you can, avoid repeating expensive things like visit()s and request()s as much as possible.
- Although the runtime of each test matters and making each test not too small is good practice always tend towards full coverage rather than limiting the scope of testing.

## Beyond this suite of tests

We have a really custom way our approaching our E2E tests with a [comprehensive README.md](https://github.com/bbc/simorgh/blob/latest/cypress/integration/README.md).

We also have [a very limited Puppeteer test suite](https://github.com/bbc/simorgh/tree/latest/puppeteer) for when we go beyond Cypress' functional limits.

## Toggles

If you need the values of feature toggles from the toggles service to determine if you should test for e.g. a component showing/not showing on a page then you can make use of the `cy.getToggles` custom Cypress command found in [cypress/support/commands/toggles.js](https://github.com/bbc/simorgh/blob/latest/cypress/support/commands/toggles.js)

The `cy.getToggles` command has a required `service` argument.

The command fetches toggles for the passed in `service` and creates a fixture by writing the `response.body.toggles` json to a file in `cypress/fixtures/toggles/` and then creates an alias from the fixture called `@toggles` that you can use in tests to get the toggles values.

You can use `cy.get('@toggles')` or access the alias using `this` in the `it` callback function.

Everything in `cypress/fixtures/toggles/` is in `.gitignore` so it isn't added to source control.

The `cy.getToggles` is memoized meaning it won't fetch from the toggles service multiple times for the same service - it will fetch only once per service per test run to limit calls made to the toggles service.

This is an example of how to use `cy.getToggles` in tests.

```js
export default ({ service }) => {
  describe('A super cool feature', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
      cy.getToggles(service);
    });

    it('should show/not show the super cool feature depending if the toggle is enabled for the service and the value is "some-cool-value"', function test() {
      const superCoolFeatureIsEnabled = path(
        ['superCoolFeature', 'enabled'],
        this.toggles,
      );
      const superCoolFeatureValue = path(
        ['superCoolFeature', 'value'],
        this.toggles,
      );

      if (
        superCoolFeatureIsEnabled &&
        superCoolFeatureValue === 'some-cool-value'
      ) {
        cy.get('[data-e2e=super-cool-feature]').should('exist');
      } else {
        cy.get('[data-e2e=super-cool-feature]').should('not.exist');
      }
    });
  });
};
```

**NB** In the example above, the `it` callback function is using the standard function syntax. Using arrow functions to access aliases via `this` won’t work because of the lexical binding of this - https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/as.html#Fixture. If you'd rather have consistency and use an arrow function then you can still do so but you have to use `cy.get('@toggles')` and introduce async code handling with `.then` and with that comes more callback nesting. Here is the same test written with an arrow function.

```js
it('should show/not show the super cool feature depending if the toggle is enabled for the service and the value is "some-cool-value"', () => {
  cy.get('@toggles').then(toggles => {
    const superCoolFeatureIsEnabled = path(
      ['superCoolFeature', 'enabled'],
      this.toggles,
    );
    const superCoolFeatureValue = path(
      ['superCoolFeature', 'value'],
      this.toggles,
    );

    if (
      superCoolFeatureIsEnabled &&
      superCoolFeatureValue === 'some-cool-value'
    ) {
      cy.get('[data-e2e=super-cool-feature]').should('exist');
    } else {
      cy.get('[data-e2e=super-cool-feature]').should('not.exist');
    }
  });
});
```
