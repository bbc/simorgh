# Components

In general this should not be used. Components should be written, edited and released via [our component library Psammead](https://github.com/bbc/psammead). For legacy reasons there are still some components here. One reason we might always leave some here, is if our component/s were so tightly coupled with Simorgh specific logic that factoring it out of the repo would have no value.
