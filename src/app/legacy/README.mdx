# Legacy Components

This folder contains components that we want to replace with new standardised components using the strangler pattern.

N.B. As referred to above we are moving away from the component-container pattern as engineers historically struggled to differentiate between the two and the distinction offered little from a maintenance perspective.

The plan is to incrementally write new components that follow standards and best practices to replace the legacy components contained in this directory.

The new components will be contained in /src/app/components.
