## Description

The `psammead-image-placeholder` component has two placeholders available. The default is a `div` with a base-64 encoded SVG background image that depicts the BBC logo. The component accepts a ratio as a prop. In the Psammead component library, Image Placeholder is used within the [psammead-figure](https://github.com/bbc/psammead/tree/latest/packages/components/psammead-figure) component.

The alternative is an AMP supported placeholder which uses the same base-64 encoded SVG but as multiple `amp-img` components, which are loaded based on the current screen size. The component adheres to the parent `amp-img` size and functions as both a fallback and placeholder. See the AMP documentation on [fallbacks and placeholders](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/develop/style_and_layout/placeholders/).

### When to use this component

Psammead Image Placeholder is designed to appear as a temporary stand-in to be replaced by an actual image, for example in the case of lazy loading.

<!-- ### When not to use this component -->

## Installation

`npm install #legacy/psammead-image-placeholder/src`

## Usage

### ImagePlaceholder

The ImagePlaceholder component is expected to contain an image as a child element.

```jsx
import ImagePlaceholder from '#psammead/psammead-image-placeholder/src';

const WrapperComponent = ({
  ratio,
}) => (
  <ImagePlaceholder ratio={ratio}>
    <img src="http://some-image.url">
  </ImagePlaceholder>
);
```

### ImagePlaceholderAmp

The ImagePlaceholderAmp component is expected to be used as a child element of an `amp-img` component. Information about `amp-img` can be found on the [AMP documentation website](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-img/)

```jsx
import ImagePlaceholderAmp from '#psammead/psammead-image-placeholder/src';

const WrapperComponent = () => (
  <amp-img src="http://some-image.url" width="645px" height="128px">
    <ImagePlaceholderAmp />
  </amp-img>
);
```

### Accessibility notes

As a `div` with a background image or as an `amp-img` for it's AMP counterpart, Psammead Image Placeholder is a presentational element without semantic meaning. As such it does not need to meet colour contrast requirements.
