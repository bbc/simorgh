## Description

The `Brand` component provides the BBC service logo (as SVG), nested inside a styled link and div. The link is currently hardcoded to "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news".

`Brand` takes a `product`, `svgHeight`, `minWidth`, `maxWidth`, `url`, `serviceLocalisedName`, `backgroundColour`, `logoColour` and `svg` as props.

The `product` is passed to a [VisuallyHiddenText](https://github.com/bbc/psammead/tree/latest/packages/components/psammead-visually-hidden-text) component, nested inside Brand.

The `serviceLocalisedName` is an optional prop referring to the local name of a service eg `Yoruba`. It is also passed to [VisuallyHiddenText](https://github.com/bbc/psammead/tree/latest/packages/components/psammead-visually-hidden-text) inside the Brand component.

The `svg` prop must contain a `group`, `viewbox` values and a `ratio`, which is used within an `svg` element. Examples of the `svg` object can be found in [#legacy/psammead-assets/src](https://github.com/bbc/psammead/blob/latest/packages/utilities/psammead-assets/README.md#service-svgs).

The `minWidth` and `maxWidth` values are required to allow the ability for the `svg` element to dynamically scale as the viewport becomes a very small size EG: feature phones.

The `svgHeight` value acts as a placeholder for the `svg` element meaning the overall banner height does not change with the dynamic scaling, also the `height` allows the contents of the `svg` element to remain vertically centred within the banner at all times.

The `backgroundColour` is the background colour and `logoColour` is the colour of the SVG and the underline when hovering/focusing on the brand.

The `url` value is the link that points to the frontpage of the service associated with the `svg`.

The `scriptLink` can be used to render [ScriptLink](https://github.com/bbc/psammead/tree/latest/packages/components/psammead-script-link) component which is a link to the service variant.

## Exports

## Usage

The typical use-case of this component is at the top of pages in a [`header` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header). When this is done it is recommend that the component is wrapped in a [`banner` role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Banner_role). However, a `header` with a `banner` role should only appear once on a page.

When using `Brand` in the header, you should ensure that `borderBottom` prop is set to true. Similarly, when using brand on the footer you should set `borderTop` to true. This ensures when in High Contrast Mode on PC and when the user changes colour preferences in FireFox that the top/bottom of the `Brand` component is visible.

`ScriptLink` component should be passed to `scriptLink` only when linking to a service variant.

```jsx
import Brand from '#psammead/psammead-brand/src';
import SkipLink from '#psammead/psammead-brand/src/skip-link';
import { igbo } from '#psammead/psammead-assets/src/svgs';
import ScriptLink from '#psammead/psammead-script-link/src';
import { POSTBOX, WHITE } from '../../../../components/ThemeProvider/palette';
import latin from '../../../components/ThemeProvider/fontScripts/latin';

const scriptLink = (
  <ScriptLink
    service="news"
    script={latin}
    href="https://www.bbc.com/serbian/lat"
  >
    Lat
  </ScriptLink>
);

const skipLink = (
  <SkipLink service="news" script={latin} href="#content">
    Skip to content
  </SkipLink>
);

const Header = (product, serviceName) => (
  <header role="banner">
    <Brand
      product={product}
      serviceLocalisedName={serviceName}
      svgHeight={24}
      maxWidth={280}
      minWidth={180}
      svg={igbo}
      url="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news"
      backgroundColour={backgroundColour}
      logoColour={logoColour}
      borderBottom
      scriptLink={scriptLink}
      skipLink={skipLink}
    />
  </header>
);
```

### When to use this component

The `Brand` component is designed to be used where a BBC logo is required as SVG. `Brand` is used in the [BrandContainer](https://github.com/bbc/simorgh/tree/latest/src/app/containers/Brand), which consumes a service context it passes to the `Brand`.

<!-- ### When not to use this component -->

### Accessibility notes

- Visually hidden text is provided (e.g. for screen reader users)
- `Brand` is keyboard-accessible and provides hover and focus styles
- The brand SVG has support for users with css disabled or high contrast mode enabled.

<!-- ## Roadmap -->

### Additional notes

- `width: 100%` is needed on both `<a>` and the `<svg>` to allow the brand to dynamically scale on the Firefox browser
