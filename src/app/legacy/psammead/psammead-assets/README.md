## Contributing

When **adding** a new export to this utility package the [export tests](https://github.com/bbc/psammead/blob/5d7395fd60bd8d73796d5a23775b4b5b36db1445/packages/utilities/psammead-assets/index.test.jsx#L11-L18) also need to be updated. When **removing** an exisiting export from this utility package the [export tests](https://github.com/bbc/psammead/blob/5d7395fd60bd8d73796d5a23775b4b5b36db1445/packages/utilities/psammead-assets/index.test.jsx#L11-L18) need to be updated and the package version requires a major change (EG: 1.2.1 -> 2.0.0) as this would be considered a breaking change due to functionality being removed.
