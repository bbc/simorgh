Where are these detention centres? And what happens inside their walls?\n\nBBC Africa Eye has analysed dozens of dramatic videos filmed during the recent uprising, and spoken with witnesses who have survived torture at the hands of the Bashir regime. Some of these protesters tell us about a secret and widely feared holding facility – The Fridge – where the cold is used an instrument of torture.\n\nInvestigation led by:\nBenjamin Strick\nAbdulmoniem Suleiman\nKlaas Van Dijken \nAliaume Leroy  \n\nProduced and Edited by:\nSuzanne Vanhooymissen \nTom Flannery \nDaniel Adamson  \n\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/subscribetoafrica\nWebsite: https://www.bbc.com/africa\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/bbcnewsafrica/\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/bbcafrica/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/bbcafrica/",
