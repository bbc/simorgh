# Simorgh Legacy Palette

Simorgh's legacy palette refer to those colours that were utilized prior to the implementation of the BBC colour rebranding. Although this palette is still currently in use, it is recommended to gradually phase out the palette's colours and replace them with the new service, foundation, and cross-platform colour palettes.
