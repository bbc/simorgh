# Simorgh's Foundation Colours

At the core of the BBC brand is a flexible range of neutral lights and darks designed to accommodate any content and complement our service colours.

These are called the foundation colours, and are based around white and black (our primary backgrounds in light and dark mode) and ten additional greys.
