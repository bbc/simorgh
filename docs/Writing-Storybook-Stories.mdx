# How to write a Storybook story

## Creating a new story

1. Create a new story file, typically called `index.stories.tsx` within the component folder
2. Create your component that you want to render in Storybook, for example:

```tsx
const Component = () => {
  return <MyFirstStory />;
};
```

3. Create a default export that returns a Storybook story, for example:

```tsx
export default {
  title: 'MyFirstStory',
  component: Component,
};
```

The `title` property defines where the story will be categorized in the Storybook sidebar.

For example, to place `MyFirstStory` in a folder called `Components`, you would set the title to `'Components/MyFirstStory'`.

## Re-using a story

The example above creates a single story. To create multiple stories for the same component, you can export a `const` with a new name and returning your component, for example:

```tsx
export const MySecondStory = () => <Component />;
export const MyThirdStory = () => <Component />;
```

Storybook will automatically detect these stories and render them in the Storybook sidebar with the names `MySecondStory` and `MyThirdStory`.

## Props in stories

You can pass `props` to your component by adding them to the story function, for example:

```tsx
export const MyFourthStory = ({ color }, { service }) => (
  <Component color={color} service={service} />
);
```

You can then reference these props as you would in a normal React component, for example:

```tsx
const MyFirstStory = ({ color, service }) => {
  return (
    <div style={color} service={service}>
      Hello World
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Args in stories

The first argument in Storybook story components is the `args` object:

```tsx
export const MyFirstStory = args => <Component {...args} />;
```

This does not need to be used, but is always the first argument. `args` are useful if you want to add 'controls' to dynamically change the props in the Storybook UI. To use it, you define the `args` and `argTypes` objects in your default export for the story. For example:

```tsx
export default {
  title: 'MyFirstStory',
  component: Component,
  args: {
    backgroundColor: 'red',
  }
  argTypes: {
    backgroundColor: {
      control: { type: 'select' },
      options: ['red', 'blue', 'green'],
    },
  },
};
```

This will render a select dropdown for all the stories for this story and allow you to change it using the Storybook UI.

([Check the Storybook website](https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/arg-types) for a full list of `argTypes` controls.)

To make use of the `args` object in your story, you can destructure it in the **first** argument of the story function:

```tsx
export const MyFirstStory = ({ backgroundColor }) => (
  <Component backgroundColor={backgroundColor} />
);
```

If you want to only have `args` for a single story out of a group of stories, you can define the `args` object in the story itself. This requires you to structure the story function differently:

```tsx
export const MyFirstStoryWithCustomArgs = {
  render: ({ backgroundColor, color }) => (
    <Component backgroundColor={backgroundColor} color={color} />
  ),
  args: {
    color: 'red',
  },
  argTypes: {
    color: {
      control: { type: 'select' },
      options: ['red', 'blue'],
    },
  },
};
```

As you can see above, you need to define a `render` function that returns the component with the `args` object destructured and then the `args` and `argTypes` below. This allows you to define `args` and `argTypes` for this specific story.

## Decorated args in stories

Typically, you'll want access to the `service` and `variant` values for use in your story. To access these values from the global context, you can destructure them in the **second** argument of your story function:

```tsx
export const MyFirstStory = ({ backgroundColor }, { service, variant }) => (
  <Component
    backgroundColor={backgroundColor}
    service={service}
    variant={variant}
  />
);
```

**Do not spread the second argument in its entirety, always destructure**. If you spread, this can potentially cause issues with rendering as the second argument contains Storybook specific functions that shouldn't be spread into components.

## Manually defining `service` and `variant` values

You can of course supply the `service` and `variant` values manually in your story, for example:

```tsx
export const MyFirstStory = ({ backgroundColor }) => (
  <Component backgroundColor={backgroundColor} service="mundo" />
);
```

This 'hard-codes' the `service` value to `mundo` for this story.

**NOTE** if you change the `service` using the global toggle in the toolbar at the top of the Storybook UI, then the story may not display as expected. For example, setting the `service` to `mundo` at the component level and changing the `service` to `arabic` using the toolbar toggle could result in the story rendering in the `mundo` language, but rendered visually right-to-left.

It's very story dependent how you use and set the `service`, so choose which fits best; having it dynamic using the toolbar toggle, or hard-coded.

## Using Contexts / Providers

The `preview.tsx` file for rendering Storybook stories contains most of our React contexts/providers to correctly render components:

```tsx
<ThemeProvider service={context.globals.service.service}>
  <ToggleContextProvider toggles={{}}>
    <ServiceContextProvider
      service={context.globals.service.service}
      variant={context.globals.service.variant}
    >
      <EventTrackingContextProvider pageData={pageDataFixture}>
        <UserContextProvider>
          <Story />
        </UserContextProvider>
      </EventTrackingContextProvider>
    </ServiceContextProvider>
  </ToggleContextProvider>
</ThemeProvider>
```

This is a very basic usage of the contexts, and sets mainly just the `service` and `variant` values from the global context (the service toolbar toggle at the top of the Storybook UI).

If you want to override these per story, you can do so by including the context you want and wrapping it around your component in the story. For example:

```tsx
const Component = () => (
  <ServiceContextProvider service="mundo" variant="default">
    <MyFirstStory />
  </ServiceContextProvider>
);
```

This will ensure that the service being rendered is `mundo`, in this example. This is useful for creating stories to demonstrate layout for left-to-right and right-to-left languages.
