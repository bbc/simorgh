# How to write a Storybook story

## Creating a new story

1. Create a new story file, typically called `index.stories.tsx` within the component folder
2. Create your component that you want to render in Storybook, for example:

```tsx
const Component = () => {
  return <MyFirstStory />;
};
```

3. Create a default export that returns a Storybook story, for example:

```tsx
export default {
  title: 'MyFirstStory',
  component: Component,
};
```

The `title` property defines where the story will be categorized in the Storybook sidebar.

For example, to place `MyFirstStory` in a folder called `Components`, you would set the title to `'Components/MyFirstStory'`.

## Re-using a story

The example above creates a single story. To create multiple stories for the same component, you can export a `const` with a new name and returning your component, for example:

```tsx
export const MySecondStory = () => <Component />;
export const MyThirdStory = () => <Component />;
```

Storybook will automatically detect these stories and render them in the Storybook sidebar with the names `MySecondStory` and `MyThirdStory`.

## Props in stories

You can pass `props` to your component by adding them to the story function, for example:

```tsx
export const MyFourthStory = (_, { service }) => (
  <Component service={service} />
);
```

You can then reference these props as you would in a normal React component, for example:

```tsx
const MyFirstStory = ({ service }) => {
  return <div service={service}>Hello World</div>;
};
```

## Args in stories

The first argument in Storybook story components is the `args` object:

```tsx
export const MyFirstStory = args => <Component {...args} />;
```

This is optional, but is useful if you want to add 'controls' to dynamically change the props in the Storybook UI. To use it, you define the `args` and `argTypes` objects in your default export for the story. For example:

```tsx
export default {
  title: 'MyFirstStory',
  component: Component,
  args: {
    backgroundColor: 'red',
  }
  argTypes: {
    backgroundColor: {
      control: 'select',
      options: ['red', 'blue', 'green'],
     },
  },
};
```

This will render a select dropdown for the story and allow you to change it using the Storybook UI.

(Check the Storybook website for a full list of `argTypes` controls.)

To make use of the `args` object in your story, you can destructure it in the **first** argument of the story function:

```tsx
export const MyFirstStory = ({ backgroundColor }) => (
  <Component backgroundColor={backgroundColor} />
);
```

## Decorated args in stories

Typically, you'll want access to the `service` and `variant` values for use in your story. To access these values from the global context, you must include the `withServicesDecorator` and add it to the `decorators` array in your default export. For example:

```tsx
export default {
  title: 'MyFirstStory',
  component: Component,
  decorators: [withServicesDecorator()],
};
```

This allows you to access the `service` and `variant` values in the **second** argument of your story function:

```tsx
export const MyFirstStory = ({ backgroundColor }, { service, variant }) => (
  <Component
    backgroundColor={backgroundColor}
    service={service}
    variant={variant}
  />
);
```

## Manually defining `service` and `variant` values

You can of course supply the `service` and `variant` values manually in your story, for example:

```tsx
export const MyFirstStory = ({ backgroundColor }) => (
  <Component backgroundColor={backgroundColor} service="mundo" />
);
```

This 'hard-codes' the `service` value to `mundo` for this story.

**NOTE** if you change the `service` using the global toggle in the toolbar at the top of the Storybook UI, then the story may not display as expected. For example, setting the `service` to `mundo` at the component level and changing the `service` to `arabic` using the toolbar toggle could result in the story rendering in the `mundo` language, but rendered visually right-to-left.

Its very story dependent how you use and set the `service`, so choose which fits best; having it dynamic using the toolbar toggle, or hard-coded.
