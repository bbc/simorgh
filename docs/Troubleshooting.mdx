If for some reason unsigned commits have been merged into the latest branch, possibly because of an admin merge, then you will need to sign any previously unsigned commits.

## How to Sign Previous Commits

The following instructions were taken from [here](https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/sdk/en/latest/docs/contributors/signing-commits.html).

1. Use `git log --show-signature` to see which commits need to be signed.
2. Go into interactive rebase mode using `git rebase -i HEAD~X` where `X` is the number of commits up to the most current commit you would like to see.
3. You will see a list of the commits in a text file. On the line after each commit you need to sign, add `exec git commit --amend --no-edit -s` with the lowercase `-s` adding a text signature in the commit body.

   Example that signs both commits:

   ```
   pick 12345 some commit message
   exec git commit --amend --no-edit -s
   pick 67890 another commit message
   exec git commit --amend --no-edit -s
   ```
