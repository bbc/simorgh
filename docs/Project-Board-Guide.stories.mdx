### Overiew of each column

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Column Name               | Issues/Pull Requests that belong in this column | When to move card to the next column | Additional context |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------| ------------------------------------ |------------------- |
| Coming Soon | Contains issues that we are going to work on within the next couple of weeks. | Once the issue has been refined by a World Service team, then it can be manually moved to "Backlog (Ready for Dev)". | n/a |
| Ready for Dev | Contains issues that have been refined. | Once you have selected an issue to work on, you must assign yourself to it and manually move the issue to the "Issues in progress".| n/a |
| Blocked | Contains issues/PRs that are blocked by either internal or external factors. | Manually move the issue/PR when it is no longer blocked. | n/a |
| Issues in progress | Contains issues that are in working progress. | If the PR that uses a [keyword to link the issue](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords) has been merged, then the cards in this column will move automatically to "Done". | PRs should not use keywords unless they definitely complete the entire issue. |
| PR in progress | Contains cards that have been automatically added here once a PR is assigned to the project "Simorgh". | It is your responsibility to move the card to "Code Review", when you wish for it to be reviewed by others. Teams prioritise code reviews over actual development. | Draft PRs should be created on first commit, so that the team can see what you are working on. Once the code is ready for review, it can be converted to a proper PR. |
| Code review | Contains PRs that are deemed ready to be reviewed by other developers. | Once 2 other developers have approved your PR, it will automatically be moved to "Ready for merge". The initial developer or a code reviewer should decide if it needs manual testing, and if so will need to manually move it to the "Ready for test" column for a tester to pick up. If your PR requires "UX, A11Y, External Review", then you will have to manually move it to that column. | If you had paired with someone on an issue, then one participant can be the reviewer but the 2nd reviewer must be a code maintainer. |
| UX, A11Y, External Review | Contains issues that require an accessibility swarm, UX or External review. | When the reviewing party approves the PR, the card will then have to be manually moved to "Ready for test" or "Ready for merge" depending on whether it needs manual testing. | [Read more about accessibility swarms](https://bbc.github.io/accessibility-news-and-you/accessibility-swarms) |
| Ready for test | Contains PRs that are ready for the test engineers to test. | Once approved by a test engineer, it is their responsibility to update the PR with an approval and move the card to "Ready for merge". | n/a |
| Ready for merge | Contains tickets that have been code reviewed | It is the responsibility of the author or code reviewer to check at this stage if the ticket needs manual testing by a tester. If not, the author or code reviewer should proceed with the merge process. If your PR has no CI (continuous integration) errors and the merge button is not disabled, then you can merge your PR and it will automatically be moved to "Done". For cleanliness, you must also delete your branch after clicking merge. | n/a |
| Done | Contains issues that are closed and PRs that are merged. | n/a | If you do, for any reason, need to move a card to "Done" manually, the definition of done is that the work is merged in the default branch. Though exceptions should be made for spikes/Proofs of Concept (PoCs). |
